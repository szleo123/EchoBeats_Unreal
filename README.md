Echo Beats: Dance of the Shadow merges the heart-pounding excitement of a rhythm game with the thrill of a platformer. Players embody a world-renowned dance artist who, upon uncovering a cursed artifact during a pivotal performance, must dance their way out of an ever-encroaching darkness.

The game aims at players with an interest in rhythm games and platformers. It caters to a wide audience by combining intuitive rhythm-based gameplay with accessible platforming mechanics, making it an appealing choice for both casual and hardcore gamers. Its unique gameplay mechanic, where players use rhythmic movements to navigate and survive, sets it apart from traditional titles in the space.

Players navigate through levels by executing rhythmic movement chains, adapting to dynamic environments that change visually and musically. Success hinges on precise timing and the ability to adapt dance moves to overcome obstacles, all while racing against the encroaching darkness.

Developed on the Unreal 5 engine, Echo Beats leverages advanced physics and stunning visuals reminiscent of Hollow Knight, ensuring a visually captivating and mechanically smooth experience. The game's design focuses on tight controls and responsive feedback, with a difficulty curve that scales to keep players continuously challenged and engaged.

The game is developed only for PC. We expect the development process to take about 5 weeks
with a talented team of 3 game developers working around the clock to ensure the best experience for our loyal players.
